# Better Memory MCP Server

An enhanced knowledge graph memory system for Claude with temporal tracking, confidence scores, entity archiving, and advanced management capabilities. This server enables Claude to maintain persistent memory across conversations with improved organization and data quality features.

**Original implementation by [Anthropic, PBC](https://anthropic.com)**  
**Enhanced by [@sockeye44](https://github.com/sockeye44) and Claude Opus**

## Enhanced Features

This enhanced version includes several improvements over the original memory server:

- **Temporal Tracking**: All observations and entities now include timestamps for when they were created
- **Confidence Scores**: Observations can have confidence scores (0-1) to indicate certainty levels
- **Entity Archiving**: Soft-delete functionality allows entities to be archived rather than permanently deleted
- **Entity Merging**: Consolidate duplicate entities while preserving all observations and relations
- **Recent Changes View**: Query recent activity within a specified time window
- **Backward Compatibility**: Seamlessly handles legacy data format while using enhanced features for new data

## Core Concepts

### Entities
Entities are the primary nodes in the knowledge graph. Each entity has:
- A unique name (identifier)
- An entity type (e.g., "person", "organization", "event")
- A list of observations

Example:
```json
{
  "name": "John_Smith",
  "entityType": "person",
  "observations": ["Speaks fluent Spanish"]
}
```

### Relations
Relations define directed connections between entities. They are always stored in active voice and describe how entities interact or relate to each other.

Example:
```json
{
  "from": "John_Smith",
  "to": "Anthropic",
  "relationType": "works_at"
}
```
### Observations
Observations are discrete pieces of information about an entity with enhanced metadata:

- Stored with timestamps and confidence scores
- Attached to specific entities
- Can be added or removed independently
- Should be atomic (one fact per observation)

Example:
```json
{
  "entityName": "John_Smith",
  "observations": [
    {
      "content": "Speaks fluent Spanish",
      "timestamp": 1734567890123,
      "confidence": 0.95
    },
    {
      "content": "Graduated in 2019",
      "timestamp": 1734567890124,
      "confidence": 1.0
    }
  ]
}
```

### System Prompt

The prompt for utilizing memory depends on the use case. Changing the prompt will help the model determine the frequency and types of memories created.

Here is an example prompt for chat personalization. You could use this prompt in the "Custom Instructions" field of a [Claude.ai Project](https://www.anthropic.com/news/projects). 

```
Follow these steps for each interaction:

1. User Identification:
   - You should assume that you are interacting with default_user
   - If you have not identified default_user, proactively try to do so.

2. Memory Retrieval:
   - Always begin your chat by saying only "Remembering..." and retrieve all relevant information from your knowledge graph
   - Always refer to your knowledge graph as your "memory"

3. Memory
   - While conversing with the user, be attentive to any new information that falls into these categories:
     a) Basic Identity (age, gender, location, job title, education level, etc.)
     b) Behaviors (interests, habits, etc.)
     c) Preferences (communication style, preferred language, etc.)
     d) Goals (goals, targets, aspirations, etc.)
     e) Relationships (personal and professional relationships up to 3 degrees of separation)

4. Memory Update:
   - If any new information was gathered during the interaction, update your memory as follows:
     a) Create entities for recurring organizations, people, and significant events
     b) Connect them to the current entities using relations
     c) Store facts about them as observations
```
